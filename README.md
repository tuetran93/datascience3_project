## Course Project - Getting & Cleaning Data

The run_analysis.R script takes in the Samsung data and produces a "tidy" dataset. This output dataset
contains the average value of all the mean and standard deviation measurements for each person and 
each activity.

The CodeBook.md script describes the meaning of each valuable in the output dataset of the run_analysis.R
script.
