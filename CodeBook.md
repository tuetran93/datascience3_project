## Explanation of each variable in the output dataset of run_analysis.R

For a detailed explanation of each variable, please see the original study.

The output from run_analysis.R is a summary dataframe of the data collected in the original
study. Each record shows an average value of the variables collected for each subject (person_id) 
and each activity (activity). The variables themselves are either mean or standard deviation
measurements of various variables observed in the original study.  

I understand very little about the original study, and thus am unable to give a more detailed
explanation of each variable.
